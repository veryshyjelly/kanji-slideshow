What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here. When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right, and we shall take it to mean _cloak_.  At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the _top hat_ ) are omitted, which we shall take to mean a _scarf_. On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitive, in which cases we shall speak of a _top hat and scarf_. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of _garment_ in general.
