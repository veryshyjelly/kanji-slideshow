(This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of _rice_ far exceeds that of _wheat_.) It occasionally takes a different shape when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to _grains of rice_. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for _water_. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, _grains of rice_ has 5 strokes, while _water_ only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for _rice_ is an abbreviation used for the _United States_ , which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish."
